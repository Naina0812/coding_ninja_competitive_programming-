Write a program that takes a character as input and prints 1, 0, or -1 according to the following rules.


1, if the character is an uppercase alphabet (A - Z).
0, if the character is a lowercase alphabet (a - z).
-1, if the character is not an alphabet.


Example:
Input: The character is 'a'.

Output: 0

Explanation: The input character is lowercase, so our answer is 0.
Input format :
The only line contains a single character.


Output format :
The only line contains 1, 0, or -1 according to the above rules.
Sample Input 1 :
v


Sample Output 1 :
0


Explanation of Sample Input 1:
The input character is lowercase, so our answer is 0.


Sample Input 2 :
V


Sample Output 2 :
1


Explanation of Sample Input 2:
The input character is uppercase, so our answer is 1.


Sample Input 3 :
#


Sample Output 3 :
-1


Explanation of Sample Input 3:
The input character is not an alphabet, so our answer is -1.


Constraints :
The input can be any single character.

code-

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	char ch;
	cin>>ch;
	if(ch>='A'&&ch<='Z')
	{
		cout<<1;
	}else if (ch>='a'&&ch<='z')
	{
		cout<<0;
	}else{
		cout<<-1;
	}
}
